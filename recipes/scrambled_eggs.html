    <h3><p>Scrambled Egg Plate</p></h3>
    <p>Easy made scrambled eggs made with fresh eggs and lightly seasoned.
        The secret to keeping the eggs from sticking is fat.
        The use of fat heated up keeps the eggs from sticking to the pan.
    </p>
    <p>To determine the right pan temperature use the water drop method. 
        This method requires you to add water droplets to the hot pan.
        If the pan is at the correct temperature the droplets should sizzle and dance around the pan.
        If they evaporate then the pan is too hot.
        If the droplets just sizzle then the pan is too cold.
